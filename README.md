[span_0](start_span)A comprehensive SQL database project designed to streamline and manage the day-to-day operations of a pharmacy[span_0](end_span). This system handles everything from employee tracking to inventory management and sales invoicing.

## Database Structure & Features
The database is built with a robust relational structure featuring multiple interconnected tables:
* **[span_1](start_span)Inventory Management:** Tracks medicines, including manufacturing/expiry dates, pricing, and stock quantities[span_1](end_span). [span_2](start_span)Connects to specific medical companies[span_2](end_span).
* **[span_3](start_span)Supplier Network:** Manages suppliers and supplier companies, tracking who provides which materials to the pharmacy[span_3](end_span).
* **[span_4](start_span)Sales & Purchases:** Records detailed sale invoices for customers and purchase invoices for incoming stock, including net amounts and profit margins[span_4](end_span).
* **[span_5](start_span)Employee & Attendance Tracking:** Maintains employee records (roles, salaries, contact info) and logs daily check-in/check-out times and attendance status[span_5](end_span).
* **[span_6](start_span)Order Processing:** Manages customer orders and links them to the specific employee who handled the transaction[span_6](end_span).

## Technical Highlights
This project demonstrates advanced SQL database management skills, utilizing:
* [span_7](start_span)[span_8](start_span)[span_9](start_span)Primary and Foreign Keys with cascading deletes to maintain data integrity[span_7](end_span)[span_8](end_span)[span_9](end_span).
* [span_10](start_span)[span_11](start_span)Complex `JOIN` operations to link customer, employee, and order data[span_10](end_span)[span_11](end_span).
* [span_12](start_span)[span_13](start_span)Nested subqueries (including correlated subqueries) for advanced data filtering[span_12](end_span)[span_13](end_span).
* [span_14](start_span)Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT`) for financial and stock analysis[span_14](end_span).
* [span_15](start_span)[span_16](start_span)Wildcard (`LIKE`) queries for dynamic text searching[span_15](end_span)[span_16](end_span).
